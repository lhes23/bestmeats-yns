## Passion for Wagyu, Delivered to Your Doorstep


Hello! I am a simple meat enthusiast dedicated to bringing the highest-quality Wagyu beef to the people of San Diego, California. My journey started with a love for exceptional cuts of meat and the desire to make premium Wagyu accessible to everyone, from home cooks to grill masters.
